## Spells
Unlike the vanilla game, the offensive spells from the schools of magic differ in more properties than just damage type.  
Each school of magic is given a unique "character" that also alters the way they are employed.  
For example, Fire magic will deliver the highest DPS, but also burns through your SP exponentially faster than Earth magic.  
In contrast, Water magic has a slow recovery time and only does a mediocre amount of damage, but is very efficient in terms of SP usage.

### Spell Properties
In general, you can assign each school of magic 3 different properties:
    - Recovery Speed: Fast / Normal / Slow recovery
    - Damage: High / Medium / Low Damage
    - Efficiency: Resourceful / Reasonable / Wasteful

*Properties for all Schools of Magic:*
    - Elemental Magic:
        - Fire: Fast Recovery, High Damage, Wasteful
        - Air: Fast Recovery, Medium Damage, Reasonable
        - Water: Normal Recovery, Medium Damage, Resourceful
        - Earth: Slow Recovery, High Damage, Reasonable
    - Self Magic:
        - Mind: Slow Recovery, High Damage, Reasonable
        - Body: Fast Recovery, Normal Damage, Wasteful
        - Spirit: Normal Recovery, Normal Damage, Reasonable
