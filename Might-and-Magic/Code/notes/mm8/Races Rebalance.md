# New Classes for MM8?
MM8 Class Count: 8 (therefore, there should be one more free slot)

## Class Overview
The corner data of the classes which are prevalent as-is.
 - Necromancer: Ranged Spell Damage, Item Support, Travel Support
 - Dragon: Ranged Damage, Tank, Travel Support, Misc Support.
 - Priest: Mass Part Heal/Buff 
 - Knight: Damage, Tank, Combat Support
 - Dark Elf: Adventure Support, damage all-rounder. Secondary Travel Support. Combination of Archer and Thief (adventurer support)
 - Vampire: Secondary Party Heal/Buff. Combination of Priest and Knight
 - Minotaur: Misc support, Minor Spellcaster, Mediocre Damage. Cannot equip helmets/boots
 - Troll: Tank, Creature Debuff
 
Conclusion:
    - Game has 3 melee beatsticks, of which the Knight vastly outclasses Minotaurs and Trolls.
    - Priest and Necromancer have virtually no contender in any of their roles and are obvious must-haves.
    - Dark Elf is the best supporter for secondary skills. 
    - Dragon is a one dimensional premium class with additional convenience built in.
    - The game features 5 party slots, yet most classes cover a greater range of aspects than it was the case in earlier MM titles. 
    - Trolls should excel through their toughness, but Knights have equally much HP until the War Troll gets GM Body Building.

## Minor Race Rebalance
 - Necromancer: M/GM Dark, E/GM Spirit, E/M Earth/Water/Air
 - Vampire: Establish as a powerful Dark Knight: Master Dark Magic, GM Mind Magic, Master Meditation
 - Dragon: GM Fire Magic. No Learning. Consider removing "ID Item", Less damage for attack?
 - Minotaur Shaman: GM Earth/Water/Air, M Body/Spirit Magic, Basic Armsmaster, GM Staff, Expert Plate  -> Becomes more like a travel mage.
 - Troll: Master Sword, GM Spear? GM Axe, Expert Shield. GM Armsmaster
 - Knight: Becomes Paladin
    - 5 HP per level, 1 SP. This becomes 6 HP and 3 SP -> Needs to make up with armor.
    - Expert Spirit Magic, Geist
    - Gets promoted to Hero: No GM Armsmaster, but Expert Light Magic
 - Dark Elf: GM Spear, Master Fire Magic, expert body building
 - Priest: Become "Inquisitors", get promoted to High Inquisitor. GM Meditation, M Body Building, GM ID Monster, Expert Armsmaster, GM Mace. Expert Bow
 - GM Alchemy: For Shaman, Priest and Necromancer
  
Conclusion:
 - The troll becomes the dumb beatsick of the game and replaces the Knight as supreme melee power. 
 - Knight underwent a drastic change. He changes class to Paladin and becomes more similar to Vampire. 
   However, Knights are more might focused while the Vampire now have a secondary spellcaster role.
   They only have access to Spirit (E/M), Body (B/E) and Light (E/M) magic, but will burn through their mana quickly. 
 - The Minotaur becomes more akin to a Druid/Travel Mage which controls the elemental forces, has magic support and is very decent in melee.
 - Dragons are no longer a premium class and have their stats reduced. However, they are still good damage dealers. 
   Access to fire and air magic makes them less one-dimensional.  
 - Priests have their might aspect improved, since more classes have access to self magic. They are aptly renamed into "Inquisitor".
 - Necromancers aren't the all-round spellcasters anymore and focus mostly on dark magic spells. No access to fire magic, master water/earth/air magic.
 - Dark Elves have their melee combat improved and gain access to GM spear, only expert water magic.
 - Vampire become more powerful spellcasters and gain access to master dark magic, GM mind magic and master meditation.
 - The game is built with the mindset that you are always buffing your party.
