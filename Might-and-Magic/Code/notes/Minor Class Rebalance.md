# Class Rebalance
Only Archers and Rangers have GM in Blaster. Clerics, Druids and Sorcerers are only Expert in Blaster.

Knight:  
    - Armsmaster MMGG -> EMMM (one of the most important changes to balance the game)  
    - Bow EEEE -> EEMM  (Knights should be well rounded fighters, including range combat) 
    - ID Monster -> EEEE (seems to be fitting for a Knight to know his opponents)    
    - Axe MMMM -> MMGG (to make them more well rounded in combat and make up for loss of GM armsmaster)    

Paladin:  
    - Plate MMMM -> MMGG Plate  
    - God Magic --BB -> --EE (novice level magic is essentially pointless)  
    - Merchant EEEE -> EMGG (moved to Paladin from Cleric)

Thief:  
    - Leather MMGG -> EEMM    
    - Dodging MMMM -> MGGG (additional GM dodge, but armor M is reached later)
    - Sword MMMM -> EMMM  
    - Mace EEEE -> -  
    - Shield BBBB -> -  
    - Elemental Magic -BBB -> -BEE (novice level magic is essentially pointless)  

Monk:  
    - Staff MMGG -> MGGG (early unarmed bonus to staff, but unarmed GM is reached later)  
    - Unarmed MMGG -> EEGG  
    - Leather MMGG -> EEMM    
    - Dodging MMMM -> MGGG (early armor bonus to dodge, but armor M is reached later)  
    - Self Magic -BEB -> -BEE (novice level magic is essentially pointless)  
    - Disarm BEEM -> EMMM (maybe not fitting for the master, but gives another master disarmer and makes it even with the spell buff)  
    - Alchemy -> BBEB  (why not? Monks were known to dabble into herbs and brewery)

Archer:  
    - Armsmater EEEE -> EEMM (Slight buff to their melee weaponry, since they have bad melee skills)  
    - God Magic --BB -> --EE (novice level magic is essentially pointless)  
    - Meditation EEEE -> EEMM (to promote their role as Warrior Mages)  
    - Shield ---- -> --BB (to give them additional late-game protection at the expansive of recovery time)  

Ranger:  
    - Leather MMMM -> MMGG (Magic resistance seems logical for an all-rounder class)  
    - Spear EEEE -> EMMM      
    - Magic -BEE -> BEEE (expert magic is reached too late to have an impact)  
    - Air, Water Magic -BEE -> BEMM (travel magic for the jack of all trades)  
    - Disarm EEEE -> EMMM  
    - Armsmaster EEEE -> EMGG (reinforces their ability to be an jack of all trades and be effective with every weapon)    
    - Perception EEMM -> EMGG (Makes them more useful as a supporter class)      
    - ID Item BBBB -> EMMM (master of none? Not anymore)      

Cleric:  
    - Merchant MMGG -> BEEE (Clerics are powerful enough, they don't need secondary party buffs)    
    - Repair MMMM -> BBEE  
    - Repair MMMM -> BBEE  
    - Mace MMMM -> EEMM  
    - Bow EEEE -> BEEE  

Druid:  
    - Staff BBBB -> EMGG  
    - Unarmed -> EEEE  
    - Magic EEMM -> EMGG     
    - Dagger MMMM -> EEMM (doesn't make sense that Druids can rank so high in Dagger so early) 

Sorcerer:  
    - Air/Water EMGG -> EMMM  (the Druid also needs to have some unique goodies)  
    - Dagger MMMM -> BBEE (Sorcerers should feel crippled in melee)   
    - Staff MMMM -> EMMM (doesn't make sense that Sorcerers can rank so high in Staff so early)  
    - Meditation MMMM -> EMGG
