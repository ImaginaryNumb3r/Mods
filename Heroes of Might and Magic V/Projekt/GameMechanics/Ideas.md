# Ideas

#Hero Rework
 - If your hero cannot learn prime in some magic school, he learns shatter magic instead.
 - Ultimates are easier for factions with weaker versions (like Haven)
 - Turn Shatter Magic into skills that are actually good to learn:
        - Shatter Dark: Dunkelschutz, Brennende Erde, Schwächender Streich, Heulen der Todesfee,
        - Shatter Destructive: Manastoß, Feuerzorn, Magie Anzapfen
 - Skill rework: "nice to have" skills require "core" skills and not vice versa.  

# Spell Rework
 - Could some towns have three spell schools?
    - Inferno: Summoning, Destruction, Dark



## Neutral
 - Earth Elemental: Regeneration, higher initiative, Large Creature

## Haven
 - Zealots: Red attack effect
 - Champion: New ability and less health?
 - Zealot: Make melee unit?
 - Renegade Engel: Add Frenzy
 - Paladin: Slightly too strong
 - Archangel: Strong spellcaster that uses light magic. Lowered attack and has 25% magic resistance. Spells: Resurrection, Divine Vengeance, Word of Light, Magic Immunity.

## Academy
 - Storm Titan: To Storm Colossus -> Melee unit which has a electric kick similar to the Crystal Dragon
 - Steel Golem: Less health, a bit less damage and 5 speed instead of 4

## Stronghold
 - Blood Eye Cyclops: Can use eye as range attack 
 - Foul Wyvern: Revert stats but make it deal enemies in a line? -> Fire Breath 

## Fortress
  - Defenders: Better stats or interesting ability. -> Just like a zombie this way
  - Brawler: 25 health, initiative 11, slightly higher cost, 3-6 damage 
  - Berserker: Cleave. Lower damage to 3-6, initiative to 11. Lower attack and defense to 6, increase speed to 6
  - Battlerager: Simply better stats or rework? Battle Charge. 3-5 damage
  - Rune Keeper or Patriarch: Magic Proof 50%

## Necropolis
 - Plague Zombie: Casts Decay on enemy  

## Dungeon
 - Rework Rider: No retaliation? or Jousting?
 - Rework Foul Hydra: Scavanging ability?

## Sylvan
 - Savage Treant: No ensnaring? But better combat and faster. Unlimited retaliation.

## Inferno
 - Pit Lord or Vermin adds "Channeling" to improve Destructive Spells
 - Hero Ideas: 
    - Summoner (summoning, strong units)
    - Hell Knight: (luck, destructive, units, hellfire)
    - Heretic (Dark magic, offense, pain link)
    - Despoiler (Dark magic and summoning?)
 - Skills: 
    - Burning Arrows -> Move to warmachines
    - Warlock's Luck: Needs Master of Fire


 - Jezebeth: Better Succubus ability
 - Fire Breathing Hound: Give Hell Hound Model instead, more single damage. Opportunity attack?
 - Vermin: Cast Weakness, very basic
 - Devil Rework:
